Iris classification
===================


This project is a template implementation of a **classification** problem.  
It can be quickly adapted to fit a **regression** task.

The logical sequence to run this implementation is:
1. execute **prepare_folder.ipynb**
2. execute **data_viz.ipynb** (**1.** and **2.** are interchangeable though)
3. execute **prepare_data.ipynb**
4. execute **train_model.py**
5. now it is possible to have some fun and to use **make_pred.py**
