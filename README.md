Iris classification
===================


This project is a template implementation of a **classification** problem.  
It can be quickly adapted to fit a **regression** task.

So far there are 4 implementations:
1. **Neural network** implemented with Keras
2. **Neural network** implemented with tensorflow
3. **xgboost** implmented with xgboost
4. **Decision tree** implemented with sklearn
